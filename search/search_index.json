To do so, you need to set up port forwarding as detailed in the prior remote connection section. Then, you can choose to setup an external IP/hostname as part of the setup script process. The automation will take your home network name (SSID) to check if you are home or not to use the correct IP/hostname automatically. The script will automatically detect your current SSID. Thus, if you are on your home network while running the setup script (<code>gen-launcher.sh</code>), it will detect your home ssid so you will just need to hit Enter. If not, you can enter ot manually (instead of using the default of your client device's [i.e., Steam Deck's] current network's SSID). You can get your home SSID for manual entry via <code>iwgetid -r</code> from the <code>konsole</code> when connected to your home network or by looking in your network history on your client device [i.e., Steam Deck] (it will be the connection name for your home network such as <code>StreetPea-5G</code>). Of course, if you want to skip this now and setup the external address later, you can always rerun the automation or choose a placeholder external IP now and manually edit it to your desired IP/hostname later.</p> Example Output [click to expand me] <pre><code>bash &lt;(curl -sLo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng/main/scripts/gen-launcher.sh)\n\n1) PlayStation 4\n2) PlayStation 5\nPlease select the number corresponding to your Playstation Console: 2\nOption 2: PlayStation 5 was chosen\n\n\n\n\nHOME ADDRESS\n-------------\n1) IP\n2) hostname\nNOTICE: Use 1 unless you created a hostname (FQDN) for your PlayStation\nPlease select the number corresponding to your address type: 1\nOption 1: IP was chosen\n\nEnter your PlayStation IP (should be xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx like 192.168.1.16):\n192.168.1.16\n\nDo you have a separate address (DNS or IP) to access this console away from home?

Additionally, for the DualSense controller to work with these features in game mode, please disable Steam Input for the DualSense controller following the \"Turning off Steam Input\" tab in this section.</p> <p>Use Buttons by Position Instead of by Label</p> <p>This enables the option to use the face buttons of your controller by position (i.e., NSEW) as opposed to by their label (i.e., ABXY). This enables you to use a Nintendo-style controller and still be able to use the buttons in the same positions as on a PlayStation controller instead of the swapped Nintendo controller positions.</p> <p>Use Steam Deck in Vertical Orientation</p> <p>For Steam Deck, this enables the option to use the Steam Deck in vertical orientation in games that assume a horizontal controller for motion controls. Since most PlayStation games assume a horizontal facing controller, (even though data is sent for using the controller in any orientation) most games only work if the Steam Deck is horizontal (like you would hold a DualSense/DualShock 4 controller). This option enables you to play those games in vertical mode by allowing you to use roll instead of yaw and having a vertical orientation correspond to a horizontal facing controller. Some games, such as Astro's playroom use the orientation values and enable you to use the controller in various different positions (i.e. this option isn't needed for using the controller in vertical orientation for that small subset of games).</p> <p>Putting your PlayStation Console to Sleep Automatically</p> <p>For <code>Action on Disconnect</code>, choose <code>Ask</code> (the default) to get prompted (use the touchscreen to respond to prompt window) about putting your PlayStation to sleep when you close your session with Ctrl+Q (you will add this shortcut as part of you controller configuration in controller section). </p> <p>If you prefer, you can also use <code>Enter Sleep Mode</code> to automatically put your PlayStation console to sleep as soon as you close your session with Ctrl+Q</p> </li> <li> <p>Video Settings</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Stream Settings</p> <p>(choose the PS5 HDR tab if you have a PS5 connected to a HDR TV/monitor (see HDR section below for more details), PS5 if you have a PS5 not connected to an HDR TV/monitor, and PS4 if you have a PS4).

The biggest factor in this seems to be chroma-sub sampling. In simple terms, the colors for an image are compressed and so you get a much lower resolution of color data than your image resolution. This means a 1080p image (with a high bitrate) will have more color data than a 720p image even if the image resolution itself ends up being 720p (since the color resolution will be higher than the equivalent 720p picture's color resolution).

This will help if your wireless connection is the problem, especially since it's very easy to do. This can fix video artifacts (white / green flashes) and audio choppiness (both results of connection problems).</p> </li> <li> <p>Try short preamble</p> <p>If you are still having trouble (I didn\u2019t need this but it can help in general and helped significantly improve performance for other streaming services such as Game Pass on my Steam Deck), try using using short preamble instead of long preamble in your router settings. You need to change this directly in your router settings for the given network and can do it per network if you set up more than one. This is incompatible with old devices (using wifi b/g instead of n or ac). Devices from 2011 and newer are required by law to support it and so will definitely work. Older devices may or may not support it depending on if they have either n or ac wireless support. Short preamble helps the \\(5GHz\\) connection for devices that support it (essentially anything that\u2019s connecting on a \\(5GHz\\) network should use it). For streaming, you can set up one network that uses short for your newer devices (\\(5GHz\\) network for me) and one with long for older devices (\\(2.4 GHz\\) network for me since older devices don\u2019t support \\(5GHz\\) anyway). My connection worked fine with long preamble on a \\(2.4 GHz\\) network for Chiaki but short (and a \\(5GHz\\) network for that matter) works better in general for devices that support it and has helped others using Chiaki as well as me to help reduce Game Pass streaming lag (which is still much worse than Chiaki and not close to native, but works well for games that don\u2019t require fast or moderately fast reaction times).</p> </li> <li> <p>For specific game issues, change game resolution settings</p> <p>For example, the game may be set to 4k / resolution mode even though it's only streaming at 1080p or even 720p. Additionally, it may be using HDR (which the Steam Deck screen doesn't support). Switching these settings off on a game level results in less processing power used on the game and thus more left over for streaming as well as hitting a higher framerate. For example, I switched <code>Ghost of Tsushima</code> from resolution mode to performance mode and noticed that the occasional performance problems I was experiencing evaporated and the visual quality became much more stable due to the lack of occasional stutters. It went from being playable but a noticeable downgrade to indistinguishable from native.</p> </li> <li> <p>Turn off VSync or the equivalent in games that use it</p> <p>VSync should only be enabled on the client side while streaming and having it enabled in the game itself can cause issues since it requires some extra overhead and can't actually sync with your screen if you're streaming the game. This resulted in issues with white flashes for me while playing Genshin Impact and Sekiro. When I turned off VSync in the Genshin Impact settings, these flashes (which had happened multiple times a minute with VSync on) disappeared.

This will help if your wireless connection is the problem, especially since it's very easy to do.

I put this last because it is the biggest performance downgrade and most of the time you don't need to do this. However, switching to 30fps / 720p at the default settings is the most surefire way to fix connection issues and a last resort if the methods with virtually no downsides don't do the trick.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"setup/configuration/#chiakichiaki-ng-via-internet-outside-of-home-connection","title":"Chiaki/<code>chiaki-ng</code> via Internet (Outside of Home Connection)","text":"<p>Chiaki/<code>chiaki-ng</code> Outside of your Home Network</p> <p>You can also either the remote connection via PSN or open up ports to connect from the Internet, but the performance will not be as good, with increased input lag being the most noticeable downgrade.
