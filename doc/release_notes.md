## System Pre-requisites

### All Systems
- GPU or integrated graphics supporting Vulkan 1.2 or higher

### Linux Flatpak
- pipewire

### Linux Appimage
- libva
- pipewire

## Where to Download 

### Linux
- Flatpak Release on Flathub as io.github.streetpea.Chiaki4deck
- Appimage  release (arm64 and x86_64) attached

### MacOS
- Homebrew
  Use brew to manage updates for the MacOS release with:
  `brew install --cask streetpea/streetpea/chiaki-ng`
-  Attached releases (arm64 and x86_64) attached

### Windows:

  `winget install --id=StreetPea.chiaki-ng -e`

## Additional Notes
Note: Pipewire required for appimage. For Linux, pipewire is required for DualSense haptics.
For flatpak, you can run with `--env=SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pulse` to use pulse instead of pipewire if you really want that (doing this means DualSense haptics won't work)
